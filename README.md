# Comix for WotLK

This is a fun addon that shows pictures and plays sounds depending on the situation.

**Note**: this is not the same addon found on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/comix), the concept is one but it was written from the ground up.

## IMPORTANT: How to install

1. [Download the package](https://github.com/waddons/Comix-WotLK/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. Open the Zip package inside which you will find a single folder named `Comix-WotLK-main`.
3. Extract or drag and drop the unique folder `Comix` into your `WoW-Directory\Interface\AddOns` folder.
4. Enjoy! And feel free to [share some love and support](#show-love--support).
